# Chegg
 Chegg but better


 If this is your first time using this program, I would suggest launching it in headless: false mode to make sure it logs in smoothly. After that do one request to a chegg page and your account session should be saved so you wont need to login again. If you dont like looking at the chromium browser while it works set back headless: true.
